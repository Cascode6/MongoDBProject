This is a suburban area northwest of Chicago. I chose it because I currently live and work predominantly within the bounds of this map.

(note: these coordinates are slightly off, by a few hundredths of a decimal place, from the dataset used in this project--
 data was downloaded and then navigated away from before the page link was copied. 
 The dataset itself should only be very slightly different, and the sample data should be almost identical.)
